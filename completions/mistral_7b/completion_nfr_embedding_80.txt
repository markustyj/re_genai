 Privacy (or lack thereof) is not a non-functional requirement, but rather a functional one. It's about the system's behavior or the data it handles, not its performance, availability, etc. In this case, the requirement is about the impact on privacy, which is a functional aspect. However, if you were to categorize it under a non-functional requirement, it would be more appropriately classified under Security, as the concern is about resisting surveillance.
