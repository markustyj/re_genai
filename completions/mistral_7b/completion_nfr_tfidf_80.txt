 Upgradability can be considered as a part of Maintainability, as it allows for changes and updates to be made to the system over time, improving its overall lifespan and ease of maintenance. However, it is not explicitly classified as one of the non-functional requirements mentioned, so it could also be argued that it falls under the broader category of "Other".
