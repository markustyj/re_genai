 Total cost (Cost) is not a non-functional requirement. However, the given requirement can be broken down into three separate non-functional requirements:

1. Free or low cost plugins for membership: This can be considered under Cost, but since software requirements are typically non-functional, it would be more appropriate to categorize it as Availability (availability of free or low-cost plugins).

2. Security: This requirement is related to ensuring the safety and privacy of user data, so it falls under the Security category.

3. Credit card payments: This requirement is about handling financial transactions, which is a part of the Security category, but it can also be considered as a separate requirement under the Payment category (specifically, Payment Security).

So, the given requirement can be categorized as:
