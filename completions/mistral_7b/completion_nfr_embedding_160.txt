 Both terms, Portability and Platform Independent, refer to the ability of a software to run on different hardware or software platforms with little or no modification. However, "Platform Independent" is a broader term that also includes the ability to use the same codebase for different programming languages or environments. So, if the requirement specifically mentions "Portability", it is referring to the ability to run on different operating systems or hardware, while "Platform Independent" might also include other aspects like language independence.
