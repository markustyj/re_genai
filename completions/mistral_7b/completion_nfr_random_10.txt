 Fault Tolerance (or Maintainability, depending on the context)


 Scalability


 Security (assuming ESAPI is an Enterprise Security API, and the operator >> might be related to input sanitization or encryption)


 Performance


 Performance (since the requirement seems to be about the efficiency of the software in terms of the loss value)


 Scalability (since the operation involves processing data in a dataframe, which could potentially be large)


 Error Messages: Maintainability


 Performance


 Architectural Decision (not directly a non-functional requirement, but related to system design and organization, which can impact other non-functional requirements like Scalability, Maintainability, and possibly others).


 Portability


 Performance


 Security (as it involves handling user data and potentially sensitive information)


 Portability


 Performance


 Security (since persistent_logins in Spring-Security is a mechanism for maintaining user sessions securely across multiple browser sessions or devices)


 Caching strategies with Memcached: Performance


 Fault Tolerance


 Scalability


 Maintainability (or possibly User Interface, depending on the specific implementation details)


 Security (as it involves storing user data with an external authentication provider)

 Security (since the requirement is about allowing a user without a specific role to invoke a method, which could potentially introduce security risks if not properly handled)

 Security (since the recurring error is related to HDFS NameNode leases, which are used for ensuring data consistency and availability, and the LeaseExpiredException can be caused by issues like improper permissions or expired tokens, which are security-related)

 The given requirement "width 100% on top of body requires scrolling" falls under the category of **Maintainability**. This is because the requirement implies that the design should be flexible enough to accommodate content that exceeds the viewport, which can help in managing and updating the content more easily. However, it also indirectly touches upon **Performance** as well, since excessive scrolling can impact the user experience.
