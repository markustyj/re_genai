 Both terms, Portability and Platform Independent, refer to the ability of software to run on multiple platforms. However, "Portability" is more specific to the code level, focusing on the ease of moving code from one environment to another, while "Platform Independent" is a broader term that includes both the code and the data, ensuring that the software can run on different hardware and operating systems without modification. So, in this context, the requirement can be classified as "Portability".

 CLS (Cumulative Layout Shifts) is a measure of visual stability on a webpage. To decrease CLS, one might implement strategies such as reserving space for ads, images, and other content that might otherwise shift the layout, or ensuring that content loads in a predictable order. While this requirement doesn't explicitly fall into any of the given categories, it can be associated with Performance and User Experience (UX) as a lower CLS score can lead to a smoother and more responsive user experience. However, for the purpose of this classification, it can be categorized as Performance.
