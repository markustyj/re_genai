 The given requirement "Android - google maps gets stuck" falls under the category of **Usability**, which is not one of the provided categories but is related to the user's experience with the software. However, since the question asks for classification into the provided categories, it would not be appropriate to include Usability. Instead, one could consider this requirement as a symptom of a potential issue in the areas of **Performance** or **Maintainability**, as a stuck application may be due to poor performance or difficult-to-maintain code.

 Synchronization requirement can be classified under Maintainability, as it involves keeping the data consistent over time, which is a part of the software's maintainability aspect. However, it also has a strong connection with Security, as the sync process should be secure to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches. So, it can be considered as a combination of Maintainability and Security.
