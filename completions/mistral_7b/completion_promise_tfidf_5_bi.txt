 Functional and Non-functional

The first part, "The product shall be easy to learn by Adjusters and Collision Estimators," is a Non-functional requirement because it deals with the usability aspect of the product, which is not directly related to the product's functionality but rather its user experience.

The second part, "The product shall be learned with two days onsite training," is a Functional requirement because it specifies a particular action or behavior that the product must support, i.e., the ability to be learned within a certain timeframe through onsite training.
