Based on the given requirement "Powershell Banner Outbound" meaning (Suricata), I would classify it under the category of **Security**.

Here's my reasoning:

* "Banner Outbound" suggests that the requirement is related to network traffic or communication, which is a common concern in security.
* "Powershell" is a scripting language, but in this context, it's likely being used to interact with a network device or system, which is a security-related task.
* "Suricata" is an open-source intrusion detection system, which is a security tool used to monitor network traffic and detect potential security threats.

Given these clues, I believe the requirement "Powershell Banner Outbound" meaning (Suricata) falls under the category of **Security**.

After analyzing the requirement "Memcache : Confusions", I would classify it under the category of **Performance**.

Memcache is a caching system that aims to improve the performance of web applications by reducing the number of database queries and improving response times. Confusions related to Memcache would likely be related to issues with its performance, such as slow query times, cache misses, or incorrect cache settings.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!

I'd be happy to help you classify the given nonfunctional software requirements into the following categories: Availability, Fault Tolerance, Maintainability, Performance, Portability, Scalability, Security.

However, I noticed that the given requirement "Is this legal/safe?" does not fit into any of the above categories. The categories I listed are related to non-functional requirements, which are characteristics of a system that are not directly related to its functionality.

The requirement "Is this legal/safe?" seems to be a question about the ethical or legal implications of a particular action or decision, rather than a characteristic of a system. Therefore, I would not classify it as a non-functional requirement.

If you meant to ask a different question, please feel free to rephrase it, and I'll do my best to help you classify it into one of the above categories.
