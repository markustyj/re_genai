The given requirement is: 'The RFS system should be able to easily interface with the BDW environment in order to load the data. â€¢ 7 data files shall be received from the BDW and loaded into the RFS system within 3 hours one day prior to the start of budgeting process every year. The data will be as of October month-end. Test files (7) shall be loaded up to 5 times throughout the year from the BDW.'

This requirement is classified as: **Non-functional**

Reason: The requirement focuses on the system's ability to interface with another system (BDW), load data, and meet specific timing and frequency requirements. It does not describe a specific function or behavior of the system, but rather a constraint on how the system should operate.
