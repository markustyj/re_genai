The given requirement is a **Non-functional requirement**.

However, the additional constraints such as "within 3 hours", "one day prior to the start of budgeting process every year", and "test files shall be loaded up to 5 times throughout the year" are non-functional requirements, as they specify performance, availability, and usability aspects of the system.
