The reason is that the requirement mentions "eval" which is a function in Python that can evaluate a string as a Python expression. This can be a security risk if not used properly, as it can allow arbitrary code execution. Additionally, the mention of "cardinal sins" implies that there may be some kind of security vulnerability or risk being referred to.
